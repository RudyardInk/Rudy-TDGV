        <p class="primer">
            When it comes to defending against the undead in places where firearms are scarce you'll have to take into account 
            other options. Blunt weapons are always easy to find but nothing beats a sword if the ultimate goal is to slice another
            human (or nearly human) head. A machete is a short blade

            "The Bodies of Men and Women Engirth"

            THE bodies of men and women engirth me, and I engirth them,
They will not let me off nor I them till I go with them and respond to them  
 and love them.
Was it dreamed whether those who corrupted their own live bodies could conceal  
 themselves?
And whether those who defiled the living were as bad as they who defiled the  
 dead?
The expression of the body of man or woman balks account,
The male is perfect and that of the female is perfect.
The expression of a wellmade man appears not only in his face,
It is in his limbs and joints also . . . . it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,
It is in his walk . . the carriage of his neck . . the flex of his waist and knees . . . .  
 dress does not hide him,
